\title{Delineates hydrological basins for large datasets}
\usage{
basindelin_big(dem, dirout = NA, trace = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{dem}{a raster object of elevations.}

\item{dirout}{an optional character vector containing a single path directory for temporarily storing tiles. Deleted after use. Tilde expansion (see \code{\link[=path.expand]{path.expand()}}) is done.}

\item{trace}{a logical value indicating whether to plot and report on progress.}
}
\value{
a raster object with individual basins numbered sequentially as integers.
}
\description{
\code{basindelin_big} is for use with large digital elevation datasets, to
delineate hydrological basins.
}
\details{
\code{basindelin_big} divides the large dataset into tiles and then
uses \code{\link[=basindelin]{basindelin()}} to delineate basins for each tile before mosaicing back
together and merging basins along tile edges if not seperated by a boundary
\enumerate{
\item If \code{dirout} is unspecified, then a directory \code{basinsout} is
temporarily created within the working directory. If \code{trace} is TRUE (the
default) then progress is tracked during three stages: (1) the basins
of each tile are plotted, (2) basins after mosaicing, but prior
to merging are plotted and (3) on each merge iteration, the number of basins
to merge is printed and processed basin is plotted.

\examples{
basins <- basindelin_big(dtm1m)
plot(basins, main = "Basins")
}

\code{\link[=basindelin]{basindelin()}} for working with smaller datasets.
